## Motivation

Reinforcement Learning has produced a lot of excitement in the AI community because of it's tendency to act based on rewards - which is very similar to how human brains work. When combined with Deep Learning, we move closer to simulating the workings of a human brain - and hence inch closer to the dream of 'True Artifical Intelligence'.

I used this project to learn try my hand at Reinforcement Learning, picking the stock example of training a RL agent to play the Atari Space Invaders game.

## Results

We trained our agent using the A3C algorithm, to achieve a score of 1000 points (This score can be improved significantly by training it longer in GPUs. It is worth noting that RL agents using A3C and trained for sufficient time have effectively 'solved' the game)

## Achievements

Submitted as part of a competition for Qualcomm employees, my submission ranked #10th in the overall rankings.
